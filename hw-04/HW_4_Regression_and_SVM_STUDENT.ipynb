    "**Since the regression model's best accuracy score was 0.84, it beats out any SVM score I received. The regression model's also received better Precision scores by a good amount, and that can be seen in my listed data above. Finally, the regression model's also received better Recall scores, again by a good amount. Clearly, the regression model outperformed the SVM model here.**"
